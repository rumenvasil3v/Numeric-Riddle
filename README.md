**Numeric Riddle** is a simple guessing game where users needs to guess random number provided by the computer. Users have  **10 tries** to guess the number and if they, they pass that difficulty and passes to the next. This simple game has different difficulties which are based on every guessed number. **For Example:**
 > We need to guess number in range (1 - 100). If we guess the number and our tries haven't burned out we increase the difficulty to (1 - 200), but there is bonus. Our tries are incresead with +5 from 10.
